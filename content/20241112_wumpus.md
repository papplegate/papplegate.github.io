Title: A Python hunts the Wumpus

Category: reimplementation

I recently rewrote the game _Hunt the Wumpus_ in Python.  In _Hunt the Wumpus_, you play a hunter who seeks to kill a creature called the Wumpus with your arrows.  You move from room to room within a cave system, looking for traces of the Wumpus and avoiding hazards.  You win if you shoot the Wumpus with an arrow; you lose if you fall victim to the Wumpus or one of the hazards. 

_Hunt the Wumpus_ comes to us from an era when games were typed in from books or sent in the mail on cassettes.  The interface is strictly text-based, and your options each turn are limited to moving to an adjacent cave or firing an arrow.  If you'd like a map of the caves, you're welcome to draw one out on paper. 

Why reimplement such an old game, and why use Python?  Picking just one aspect of the game, the cave rooms are arranged like the vertices on a dodecahedron (a 20-sided solid) and connected by the dodecahedron's edges.  This arrangement is naturally represented by a graph, rather than a simple grid, which adds to the project's interest.  Functionally, Python includes the `cmd` module in its standard library, and that module is tailor-made for creating text-based interfaces like the one that _Hunt the Wumpus_ uses.  Personally, I wrote Python code in a previous role and wanted to spend some more time with the language.  

Why Python?
Don't use it at work, would like to get back to it
The cmd module provides a natural platform for implementing turn-based text games

Details
network as dictionary of int: tuple[int, int, int]
use the cmd module
recursion

Possible improvements
Less violent setup -- you're trying to photograph the Wumpus with a camera drone, instead of killing it with arrows 
Add a turn limit
Make the Wumpus try to catch the player
