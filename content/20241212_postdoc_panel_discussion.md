Title: Industry Job Search panel discussion

I recently participated in a panel discussion on finding jobs outside of academia for postdocs at Penn State.  The participants asked a lot of great questions, and I've recorded some of those questions and my responses here.  

# Why did you move to an industry role?

I moved to industry to find stability.  I was successful as an academic -- I published over 20 peer-reviewed articles with over 1000 citations, was co-principal investigator on an NSF grant, and taught classes.  After finishing my Ph. D., though, I could only get contract roles for one or two years at a time.  I wanted a longer-term position where I wouldn't need to move frequently so that I could have a family. 

My post-academic career has been just as intellectually stimulating and engaging as my academic work.  One way in which my post-academic career has improved on my academic work is the number of people I impact positively.  As an editor and team manager, I helped hundreds of researchers publish their work; as a software engineer, my work reaches tens of thousands of end users. 

# Your degrees are in geology, but you work as a software engineer.  How is that possible?

My research taught me the basics of computing.  Geology is just as quantitative as any of the sciences, and my research focused on statistical modeling.  The problems I was working on couldn't be solved, except by computation.  

I built my ability to write code in all of my post-academic roles.  As an editor and team manager, I took online classes and applied what I learned to my work tasks, lobbying my managers to let me help the business with my new coding skills.  I then made the jump to a data-science role and finally a software-engineering position.

# You've clearly needed to learn a lot to change careers.  How do you find time and motivation to learn new things?

I do really enjoy learning new things.  It's what gets me out of bed in the morning.  For me, the secret is to spend about 15 minutes a day on learning and to do it consistently.

# You mentioned that you have gotten your employers to let you write code in working time when that wasn't strictly your job.  Why would an employer support you to do that work, instead of hiring someone with a more complete skill set?

Of course, it's expensive to hire an extra person, whereas, if you're already there and able to do something useful for no additional money, then that's an attractive proposition for an employer.  I've generally been successful when pitching projects, but occasionally I have been told no.  I left one company and joined another for that reason.

# What should we do as postdocs to prepare for industry roles that we might not already be doing?

I assume that your research doesn't map easily to an industry role.  I didn't think that industry positions where I would be hired just based on my research existed.  I needed to find another way in.

If that's true, I'd suggest identifying some aspect of your day-to-day work that you enjoy and that does map to an industry role.  Possibilities include software engineering, project management, or instructional design.  Next, identify a certification in an area where you'd like to work and work toward that certification.  All the while, look for ways to apply what you're learning to your daily work, so that you'll be able to show on your resume that you have carried out the responsibilities of that role.

I want to be clear that right now (late 2024) is a tough time to change jobs, especially if you're trying to break out of academia and into industry.  I think the steps I've identified still make sense, but plan for this transition to take some time. 

# I've been applying to industry roles without any luck.  Should I apply to roles where I don't have all of the qualifications?

I've read that, if you meet 75% of the qualifications listed on a job posting, you should apply.  I think applying is generally a good idea.  You might get lucky, and you can't win if you don't play.

# I've heard that, when a role asks for either a CV or a resume, that's a trick.  What do you think?

I've never seen that situation, but let me talk about application documents.  Resumes are very different from CVs.  My advisor used to say that a CV should include anything that your grandmother would be proud of -- every conference talk, every minor award.

In contrast, everything on your application for an industry role should show that you can do the job that you're applying to.  For example, every bullet point on your resume should be relevant to the role.  A good bullet point states what you did and what impact it had.  Ideally, you should also include some quantification of either what you did, the outcome, or both.

Your resume may de-emphasize or leave out some things that would be very prominent on your CV.  My resume lists my education at the very bottom, and my research isn't mentioned at all.

A job application is just a document that gets you an interview.  It has no other purpose, so don't overthink it.

# Do you have any regrets from your postdoc?

I have no regrets in terms of things I would like to have done as an academic and didn't get to do.  If anything, I wish I had moved to industry sooner.  

# We've all heard about recent recent layoffs in the tech industry.  What areas do you think will be less prone to layoffs in the next few years? 

If I knew safe industries, I'd be trying to move to them.  There are just no guarantees.  Anyone can be laid off -- it's happened to me.  I polished up my resume and got a new job.  Try to perform well at your job and keep your resume current.
