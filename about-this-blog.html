            <p>Most things I've learned are absurdly simple in hindsight.  This blog records some of those things.</p>
<p>The name comes from Sherlock Holmes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So, Watson,” said he, suddenly, “you do not propose to invest in South African securities?” <br>
I gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as I was to Holmes’s curious faculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable. “How on earth do you know that?” I asked.<br>
He wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand and a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes. “Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback,” said he... “I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect... [b]ecause in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple.”<br>
“I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.”<br>
“You see, my dear Watson... it was not really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did not propose to invest your small capital in the goldfields.”<br>
“I see no connection.”<br>
“Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection. Here are the missing links of the very simple chain..."<br>
“How absurdly simple!” I cried.<br>
“Quite so!” said he, a little nettled.<br>
-- Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventure of the Dancing Men"</p>
